# Function-Plot-Maker-Using-Python-and-Matplotlib
 This Python project, "Function Plot Maker," uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the matplotlib library to create plots of sine, cosine, and tangent functions. Users can interactively choose which function to plot, with features like gridlines, axis labels, and adjustable y-limits for better visualization.
